# firstproject



+ Project background
    We will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully
    Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars
    Other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage
+ Problems you want to find answers
If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch
The correlation of multiples factors ( payload, launch sites, launching year, etc.) on the success rate of the landing of the first stage of Falcon 9
Identify the requirements of launch sites (close to coastline, or the residential area?)
Which ML model provides the best prediction for the success rate of the rocket launch
